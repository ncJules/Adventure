say("Just a few years ago, our dear Friend Balin departed with a few of ours to take back the wonderful kingdom of Khazad-dûm. Among the ones who joined him, there also was Nadihm, your sister's son. As we all found out last year, their attemps to take back what was rightfully ours, failed and our friends were doomed to die in the mines. But now I received a glimpse of hope: There are rumours about confused beeings that have been spotted between Lórien and the former entry to the mines.")
say("I have chosen you as the most fitting one for the quest to find out if there are any survivors in hope that you will find some or at least find closure in the grieving for your beloved nephew.")

say("I expect you to leave for this quest within the next two weeks. If you are in need of any assistance, I will provide you with whatever I can.")

say("Two rainy weeks have passed since you arrived at the foot at the mountains. But this morning, the sun finally decided to come out and dry your damp beard. At noon, just when you decided to take a short break in the shadows of an old oak, you heard it. Someone was singing in the far distance. You immediately got up and followed the voice...")

say("Now you are at the entrance of a cave so well hidden, that you wouldn't have found it, if it weren't for that voice which is now coming from the inside. You recognise the tune, it's an old dwarf's lullaby.")
say("Full of hope that your journey might be close to an end, you enter.")
